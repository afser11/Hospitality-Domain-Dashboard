💼 Key Finding: Approximately 62% of total revenue is generated from Luxury Rooms, with the remaining 38% coming from Business Class Rooms.
📊 What This Means: The data clearly shows that Luxury Rooms are the dominant source of revenue, highlighting the importance of catering to the high-end market segment. This insight could drive strategic decisions on resource allocation, marketing efforts, and service enhancements to maximize profitability in the luxury segment.

📊 I uncovered an intriguing trend: while the Average Daily Rate (ADR) has remained consistent, the occupancy rates (total successful bookings) have fluctuated significantly over time.

📌 Stable ADR: The consistency in ADR suggests that pricing strategies have been well-maintained, ensuring steady revenue per available room.

📌 Fluctuating Occupancy: Despite the stable ADR, occupancy rates have shown variability, indicating external factors such as seasonality, market demand, or changes in customer preferences.
